## Listaller software components internal directory

Modules are software dependencies, which are required by other software to be run.
They can be libraries, artwork, Python-modules, basically everything which can be referenced
by a 3rd-party application.

Each module is described by an AppStream metadata file, which is shipped by the upstream project.
Since some projects don't ship these files yet, Listaller provides templates for some commonly
used components.

The template files are standard AppStream upstream metadata files, extended with some Listaller-specific
tags. They should never be used outside of Listaller.
