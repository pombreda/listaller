## Listaller software modules directory
Modules are software dependencies (=libraries, artwork, everything which can be referenced
by a 3rd-party application, ...) which can be satisfied using Listaller and which don't need tight
system integration, like frameworks do.

Distributors and other software can drop new files into this directory, making modules known to
Listaller, so it can resolve dependencies during a setup process.

The file format is described in Listaller's documentation.
