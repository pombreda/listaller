## Frameworks directory
This directory stores information about frameworks which might or might be not installed
on the system.

A framework is a large part of infrastructure which requires close system integration.
Frameworks are usually provided by a Linux distributor. The 3rd-party software installer
Listaller has no option to install a framework through 3rd-party sources. If the files
in this directory define a way to install the framework from the official distributor
sources, Listaller might use it to satisfy dependencies.

The format to define frameworks is described in Listaller's documentation.

This directory will be used by depscan to detect frameworks!
