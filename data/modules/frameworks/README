## Frameworks directory

This directory stores information about frameworks which might or might be not installed
on the system.

A framework is a large part of infrastructure which requires close system integration.
Frameworks are usually provided by a Linux distributor. The 3rd-party software installer
Listaller will not attempt to install a framework through 3rd-party sources. If the files
in this directory define a way to install the framework from the official distributor
sources, Listaller might use it to satisfy dependencies.

A framework is build using modules, which are described in module-info files.
The format to define frameworks is described in Listaller's documentation.

Distributors might install framework definitions to /usr/share/modules/frameworks
