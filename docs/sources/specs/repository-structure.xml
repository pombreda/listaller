		<title>What is an IPK package repository?</title>

		<para>
			IPK package repositories are online sources for Listaller packages. These sources can be used to provide updates for
			installer applications, or to make Listaller-packaged applications available in the software management UIs of distributions.
		</para>
		<para>
			Repositories can also be used to provide dependencies, to enhance the abilities for Listaller's dependency solver to satisfy a given
			dependency.
