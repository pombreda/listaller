	<title>Depscan - Scan for software dependencies</title>

	<para>
		Depscan scans ELF executables' library dependencies and generates a nice report for you.
		This makes it easier to find out what your software's, dependencies are. Listaller uses this tool at
		build-time to generate the automatic dependency-list, but you may use it as well to find out why an application
		has dependency X.

		<para>
			Listaller uses this tool at build-time to generate the automatic dependency-list,
			but you may use it as well to find out why an application has dependency X.
			It will also show you immediately if you are using <literal>Franmeworks</literal> which are present on the system,
			or if you use <literal>Modules</literal> which can not be satisfied automatically.
		</para>
		<para>
			Depscan will later be extended to support dependency-detection for other languages, e.g. Python/Ruby too.
