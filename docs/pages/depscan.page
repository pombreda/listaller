    <desc>Depscan scans ELF executables' library dependencies and generates a nice report for you.
    This makes it easier to find out what your software's, dependencies are. Listaller uses this tool at
    build-time to generate the automatic dependency-list, but you may use it as well to find out why an application
    has dependency X.</desc>

<title>What is Depscan?</title>

       <p>Depscan scans ELF executables library dependencies and generates a nice dependency report for you.
       This makes it easier to find out what your software's, dependencies are.</p>

       <p>Listaller uses this tool at build-time to generate the automatic dependency-list,
       but you may use it as well to find out why an application has dependency X.</p>

       <p>Depscan will later be extended to support dependency-detection for other languages, e.g. Python/Ruby too.</p>
