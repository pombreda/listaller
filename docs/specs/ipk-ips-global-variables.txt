===== Listaller Global Variables =====

==== Install-Time Variables ====

Install-Time variables start with a //$// sign and are replaced with their value during the
software installation process.They are placeholders for values (file paths in most cases) defined by
the user, the software installer or the Linux distribution itself.
This listing contains all genuine Listaller Install-Time variables:

^ Variable      ^ Replaced with                                                                           ^
| $INST         | "///opt/appfiles//" in ROOT installation, otherwise with "//$HOME/.appfiles"//'         |

  s := s + #13'$SHARE : Replaced by "/usr/share" on ROOT installation, "$HOME/.appfiles/" on installation in Home-directory.';
  s := s + #13'$OPT : Points to "/opt" if user is ROOT, otherwise it does the same as $INST';
  s := s + #13'$BIN : Pointer to "/usr/bin" if ROOT, else "$HOME/applications/binary"';
  s := s + #13'$SBIN : Pointer to "/usr/sbin" if ROOT, else "$HOME/applications/binary"';
  s := s + #13'$LIB : Pointer to "/usr/lib64" (on Fedora 64bit machines) or to "/usr/lib" (all others) if ROOT, else "$HOME/.appfiles/lib64" or "$HOME/.appfiles//lib"';
  s := s + #13'$LIB32 : Replaces with 32bit lib dir "/usr/lib32" if ROOT, else "$HOME/applications/"';
  s := s + #13'$APP : Pointer to "/usr/share/applications", if ROOT, else "$HOME/.applications"';
  s := s + #13'$ICON-# : Points to "/usr/share/icons/hicolor/#x#/apps" if user is ROOT, else to "$HOME/.appfiles/icons/#x#". The "#" symbol has to be replaced with the icon size: 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 265 pixels.';
  s := s + #13'$PIX : Symbol for general pixmaps. Points to "/usr/share/pixmaps" if ROOT, else "$HOME/.appfiles/icons/common"';
  s := s + #13'($HOME stands for the home directory of the current user. It is NO Listaller placeholder and cannot be used as one!)';
