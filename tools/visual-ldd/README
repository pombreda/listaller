Visual Dependency Walker is a tool that will show you a graphical tree of
all the shared libraries that a given ELF binary links to. It can be used
to figure out why your program is linked against a certain library, and to 
checkfor version conflicts.

Unlike ldd, which displays the dependencies in a flat list, this tool
displays the dependencies in a tree, allowing you to see which shared
libraries an application *really* needs.


To compile visual-ldd, simple run:
./configure
make

No installation is required. After compilation, simply run it directly:
./visual-ldd
