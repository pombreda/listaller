Listaller 0.5.x

=== Compiling instructions ===

To compile Listaller, make sure that you have all required libraries (development files!) installed.
Then continue.

You should use CMake directly to build Listaller:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. <flags>
Possible flags are:
 -DTOOLS=OFF -- Disable building of Listaller's command-line tools (libuild/lipa/etc.)
 -DLIBUILD=ON -- Build the LIBuild facilities
 -DPATCHELF=ON -- Build patchelf utility (we don't use this at time, so you usually don't want to enable it)
 -DVISUAL_LDD=ON -- Build the Visual-LDD utility (you need Qt4 for that)
 -DTESTS=ON -- Enable Listaller's basic Unit Tests
 -DTEST_DEPMANAGER=ON -- Enable test for Listaller's dependency solver
 -DTEST_SECURITY=ON -- Enable Listaller signing/security tests

As an alternative, you can also use the prepare script:
First cd to the source directory and execute
./prepare <flags>
Flags are for example "--enable-tests" to enable tests. Check the script for more parameters.

=== Installation ===

To install the compiled binaries and required data files, execute
"make install" with superuser rights.
