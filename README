Listaller 0.5.x

=== Compiling instructions ===

To compile Listaller, make sure that you have all required libraries (development files!) installed.
Then continue. (the build system will complain about missing dependencies)

You should use CMake directly to build Listaller:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. <flags>
Possible flags are:
 -DTOOLS=OFF          -- Disable building of Listaller's command-line tools (libuild/lipa/etc.)
 -DLIBUILD=ON         -- Build the LIBuild facilities
 -DPATCHELF=ON        -- Build patchelf utility (we don't use this at time, so you usually don't want to enable it)
 -DVISUAL_LDD=ON      -- Build the Visual-LDD utility (you need Qt4 for that)
 -DTESTS=ON           -- Enable Listaller's basic Unit Tests
 -DTEST_DEPMANAGER=ON -- Enable test for Listaller's dependency solver
 -DTEST_SIGNING=ON    -- Enable Listaller signing tests
 -DAPI_DOCS=ON        -- Add a new target "api-docs" which allows you to build Listaller's source documentation

=== Installation ===

To install the compiled binaries and required data files, execute
"make install" with superuser rights.

=== Building documentation ===
To recreate Listaller's full documentation in HTML,
enable the API docs and execute this command:
make documentation api-docs
