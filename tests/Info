Listaller tests info file
=========================

Quick notes about the Listaller testing directory:
 * These are _not_ automatic unit tests!
 * Each test has to be compiled manually
 * Some of the testing stuff requires the Foo test package
 * Ensure PackageKit is installed and running before performing a test
 * Most tests are command-line tools, but some have a GUI. Just compile it
   for the widgetset you like. (LCL makes it possible!)
 * Some tests might not be up-to-date. Please contact me if they need to be updated!
 * This directory contains some useful developer stuff too. Just play around a little :P
